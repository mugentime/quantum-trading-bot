## üîß Railway Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Add Environment Variables in Railway Dashboard
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Navigate to "Variables" tab
4. Add each variable one by one:

**Required Variables (Add these manually):**
```
BINANCE_API_KEY = your_actual_api_key
BINANCE_SECRET_KEY = your_actual_secret_key
BINANCE_TESTNET = false
```

**Optional Variables (Add if needed):**
```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = your_telegram_token
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID = your_chat_id
```

### Step 2: Verify Pre-configured Variables
These are already set in `railway.json` but can be overridden in Railway dashboard:
- RISK_PER_TRADE=0.80
- DEFAULT_LEVERAGE=8
- MAX_LEVERAGE=10
- MIN_LEVERAGE=8
- MAX_CONCURRENT_POSITIONS=1
- STOP_LOSS_PERCENT=0.05

BINANCE_TESTNET=true
RISK_PER_TRADE=0.20      # Lower risk for testing
DEFAULT_LEVERAGE=5        # Conservative leverage for testing
ENVIRONMENT=staging
DEBUG=true
```

### For Production:
```bash
BINANCE_TESTNET=false     # REAL MONEY TRADING
RISK_PER_TRADE=0.80      # Full aggressive strategy
DEFAULT_LEVERAGE=8        # Optimized leverage
ENVIRONMENT=production
DEBUG=false
```
