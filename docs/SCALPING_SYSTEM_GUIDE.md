# Advanced Correlation-Based Scalping System

## üéØ System Overview

This is a complete redesign of the correlation-based signal generation system, optimized for 1-5 minute scalping on Binance futures. The system targets **20-50 high-probability signals daily** with **75-85% win rates** and **0.3-0.8% profit per trade**.

### Key Features

- **Micro-Timeframe Correlation Analysis**: 1m/3m/5m correlation tracking with tick-level precision
- **Market Regime Adaptation**: Dynamic parameter adjustment for volatile vs calm periods
- **Volume Confirmation**: Advanced volume pattern analysis for signal validation
- **Order Book Analysis**: Bid-ask spread and depth analysis for optimal entry/exit timing
- **Multi-Condition Exit Management**: Profit targets, time-based exits, and correlation reversal detection
- **False Signal Filtering**: Sophisticated noise reduction algorithms
- **Comprehensive Backtesting**: Realistic market microstructure simulation

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **ScalpingCorrelationEngine** (`core/scalping_correlation_engine.py`)
   - Real-time correlation analysis across multiple timeframes
   - Market regime detection and adaptive parameters
   - High-frequency signal generation with quality scoring

2. **ScalpingBacktestEngine** (`core/scalping_backtest_engine.py`)
   - Comprehensive backtesting with realistic market simulation
   - Performance metrics and quality analysis
   - Cost analysis including slippage and commissions

3. **ScalpingSystemManager** (`scalping_system_integration.py`)
   - Complete system integration and coordination
   - Live trading session management
   - Performance monitoring and optimization

## üìä Signal Generation Process

### 1. Micro-Timeframe Correlation Analysis

The system analyzes correlation patterns across three timeframes:
- **1m**: Ultra-fast scalping signals (5-15 minute holds)
- **3m**: Fast scalping signals (15-30 minute holds)  
- **5m**: Standard scalping signals (30-60 minute holds)

### 2. Market Regime Detection

Four market regimes with adaptive parameters:

| Regime | Characteristics | Strategy |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| **CALM** | Low volatility, stable correlations | Larger position sizes, tighter stops |
| **VOLATILE** | High volatility, unstable correlations | Smaller positions, wider stops |
| **BREAKDOWN** | High vol + high correlation | Maximum position sizes, tight stops |
| **TRANSITIONAL** | Mixed conditions | Conservative approach |

### 3. Signal Quality Levels

- **PREMIUM** (85%+ confidence): Maximum position size, highest priority
- **HIGH** (70-85% confidence): Standard position size
- **MEDIUM** (55-70% confidence): Reduced position size
- **LOW** (<55% confidence): Filtered out

### 4. Volume Confirmation

Signals require volume validation:
- Volume surge factor > 1.2x average
- Volume trend analysis (5-minute)
- Institutional vs retail flow detection
- Volume profile scoring

## üé™ Entry and Exit Mechanics

### Entry Timing

1. **Correlation Breakdown Detection**: Identifies correlation changes > 0.25
2. **Momentum Divergence Analysis**: Looks for >0.2% price divergence
3. **Order Book Analysis**: Ensures tight spreads (<5 basis points)
4. **Volume Surge Confirmation**: Requires 20%+ volume increase
5. **Optimal Entry Window**: 30-60 second execution window

### Exit Conditions

Multiple exit triggers:
1. **Take Profit**: 0.8-2.2% targets based on volatility
2. **Stop Loss**: 0.8-1.5% stops based on regime
3. **Time-Based**: 10-60 minute maximum hold times
4. **Correlation Reversal**: Exit when correlation normalizes
5. **Volume Exhaustion**: Exit on volume decline

### Risk Management

- **Position Sizing**: 2% base risk per trade, adjusted by confidence
- **Maximum Concurrent**: 5 active signals maximum
- **Daily Drawdown Limit**: Stop trading at 5% daily loss
- **Regime Adjustment**: Position sizes adapt to market conditions
