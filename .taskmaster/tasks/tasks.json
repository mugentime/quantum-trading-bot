        "priority": "high",
        "dependencies": [],
        "details": "The DataCollector class is missing critical methods like start() which is causing the bot to crash. Need to implement:\n- async start() method to initialize exchange connection\n- async stop() method for cleanup\n- WebSocket connection handling for real-time Binance data\n- Data buffering and cleanup mechanisms\n- Error handling and reconnection logic",
        "testStrategy": "Test with mock data first, then with Binance testnet to ensure data flows correctly"

        "dependencies": [
          1
        ],
        "details": "The CorrelationEngine needs to calculate real-time correlations between trading pairs and detect when correlations break down. Implement:\n- Multi-symbol correlation matrix calculation using pandas/numpy\n- Rolling window correlation updates for efficiency\n- Statistical significance testing for correlation strength\n- Memory-efficient calculations for real-time processing\n- Correlation breakdown detection algorithms\n- Integration with DataCollector for live data feeds",
        "testStrategy": "Unit tests with known correlation data, performance benchmarks, and validation against statistical libraries"

        "details": "Generate trading signals when correlations deviate significantly from historical norms. Implement:\n- Deviation threshold detection using statistical significance\n- Signal confidence scoring based on correlation strength and p-values\n- Multi-timeframe analysis integration for signal validation\n- False positive filtering using multiple confirmation criteria\n- Signal types: correlation_breakdown, mean_reversion, momentum_continuation\n- Integration with CorrelationEngine outputs and market regime analysis\n- Risk-adjusted position sizing recommendations",
