# Task ID: 2
# Title: Complete CorrelationEngine Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the correlation calculation algorithms and deviation detection for multi-symbol analysis
# Details:
The CorrelationEngine needs to calculate real-time correlations between trading pairs and detect when correlations break down. Implement:
- Multi-symbol correlation matrix calculation using pandas/numpy
- Rolling window correlation updates for efficiency
- Statistical significance testing for correlation strength
- Memory-efficient calculations for real-time processing
- Correlation breakdown detection algorithms
- Integration with DataCollector for live data feeds

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests with known correlation data, performance benchmarks, and validation against statistical libraries
