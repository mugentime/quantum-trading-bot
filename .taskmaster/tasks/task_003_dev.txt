# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement SignalGenerator Logic
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create intelligent signal generation based on correlation deviations and market analysis
# Details:
Generate trading signals when correlations deviate significantly from historical norms. Implement:
- Deviation threshold detection using statistical significance
- Signal confidence scoring based on correlation strength and p-values
- Multi-timeframe analysis integration for signal validation
- False positive filtering using multiple confirmation criteria
- Signal types: correlation_breakdown, mean_reversion, momentum_continuation
- Integration with CorrelationEngine outputs and market regime analysis
- Risk-adjusted position sizing recommendations

# Test Strategy:
Backtest with historical correlation data, validate signal quality with precision/recall metrics, test false positive rates
