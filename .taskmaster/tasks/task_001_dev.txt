# Task ID: 1
# Title: Fix DataCollector Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Complete the missing start() method and implement WebSocket data streaming functionality
# Details:
The DataCollector class is missing critical methods like start() which is causing the bot to crash. Need to implement:
- async start() method to initialize exchange connection
- async stop() method for cleanup
- WebSocket connection handling for real-time Binance data
- Data buffering and cleanup mechanisms
- Error handling and reconnection logic

# Test Strategy:
Test with mock data first, then with Binance testnet to ensure data flows correctly
